# This program will prompt the user for their date of birth, and then it will calculate current age, the day of the week you were born on, and the number of days until your next birthday.

## To use the program, simply run it in a Java environment and follow the prompts.

## Version: 1.0.2
## An optimized version in ES6:
## In this optimized version, we've used arrow functions and destructuring assignment to simplify the code and make it more concise. We've also provided default values for the today parameter in the age and daysUntilNextBirthday functions to allow them to be called with just the birthdate argument.


## Version: 1.0
## In this JavaScript version, we've used built-in functions to handle date parsing, formatting, and calculations, which simplifies the code and makes it more concise. We've also used prompt() to get user input and console.log() to print output to the console.
